# tic! tac! toe!
by Jessi B. for the Odin Project

## What is this?
This simple two-player game was designed as a project for the Odin Project intermediate Javascript course. Areas of focus for this project
include scope, constructors, factory functions, and IIFEs. Responsive design has not been taught yet, so visual scalability was not taken into 
account when designing this game. It works best on a desktop computer rather than a mobile device.

## How to play
Click to play! This is a classic game of tic-tac-toe designed to be played by two human players. Players can enter their names and click to place 
their marks. Once the game is complete, a dialog will appear inviting users to play again.
